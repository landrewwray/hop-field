# Interatomic terms arguments are: 
# [atom interacted with ('X' means any)] [hop symmetry] [my orbital] [neighbor orbital] [initial energy at min radius] [min energy] [max energy] [min dist (Angstroms)] [max dist (Angstroms)] [number of sigmoids]

# Note that the sign of the hopping term is positive for p<-->p sigma, as this hopping is between positive and negative lobes. The 'sigma p s' term has a negative hopping sign for components of p-->s hopping along positive axial directions, and the sign will flip for negative p-->s axial directions as required by symmetry.
