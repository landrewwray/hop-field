# Atomic terms arguments are: [orbital] [initial energy] [min energy] [max energy] [number of mL states (may be removed in future updates; redundant to orbital def)]

@Interatomic Coulomb terms
X _none_ E -1 -1.5 0 0.5 10 5

X sigma p 2 1 3 0.5 2 5

# Intertomic terms arguments are: 
# [element interacted with ('X' means any)] 
# [interaction symmetry (sigma and pi for orbital terms; _none_ and _keep_ for 'E' terms)]
# [orbital ('E' means a classical energy term not reflected in the local Hamiltonian)]
# [initial energy at min radius] [min energy] [max energy]
# [min dist (Angstroms)] [max dist (Angstroms)] [number of sigmoids]

#note that 'E' terms with reversed atom order will be removed from the Hamiltonian to avoid double counting.  For example, if an E terms is created for C-->H, later H-->C E terms will be removed.  To stop this from happening, set the interaction symmetry (argument #2) to _keep_.
